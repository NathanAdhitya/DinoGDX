# DinoGDX
## What is this?
DinoGDX is a... questionable implementation/clone of Chrome's Offline Dinosaur Game with Java and LibGDX.  
Obstacles include multiple custom-made and original obstacles to demonstrate the use of OOP inheritance and polymorphism.  
The available obstacles are Bird, Cactus, Cart, and Snake.  
There is only one background entity object (has no colliders) that serves as decoration which is Cloud.  

## Differences from original game
- Dinosaur cannot duck
- More obstacles in this clone
- No dark mode
- No stars
- Obstacle generation is mostly random. There is no guaranteed solution.
- Speed calculations may differ
